# LSM6DSV80X-STM-Library
### Stable Branch

This branch is considered ready for release. It will also only include the files considered the library

## TODO:
- ~Data size error~
- ~Now, gyroscope and accelerometer not enabling~
- ~Combine recieved data into 16 bits~ 
- ~Process hex data into standard decimal~
- ~Test if data is correct~ 
- Machine learning rules etc

### May end up becoming multiple files if this becomes intolerable
